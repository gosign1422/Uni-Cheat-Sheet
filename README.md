## 🏗️ Engineering & Ownership

UniCheatSheet was designed and built as a **production-grade web application** with full
end-to-end ownership — spanning development, deployment, analytics, and maintenance.

### Tech Stack
- **HTML5** — semantic, accessible markup
- **CSS3** — custom, responsive layouts with no UI frameworks
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — client-side logic and interactivity

### Analytics, Hosting & Infrastructure
- **Google Analytics** — traffic analysis and usage insights
- **Microsoft Clarity** — user behavior and interaction heatmaps
- **Hostinger** — website hosting and deployment
- **ImageKit & Cloudinary** — CDN-based image hosting and optimization

These choices were **intentional**:
- Minimal dependencies
- Fast load times
- Low operational overhead
- High reliability under traffic spikes

The entire codebase is **open-sourced on GitHub**, enabling transparency and reuse by
students from other universities.

## 🤝 Collaboration with Local Businesses

To keep the platform **free and independent**, UniCheatSheet implemented a
**cost-per-poster collaboration model** with local businesses.

### How It Worked
- Businesses were represented via **physical and digital posters**
- Each poster redirected users to:
  - Business websites
  - Google Maps locations
  - Contact or inquiry pages
- No advertisements appeared inside study flows

This approach:
- Generated **$100+ USD**
- Fully covered hosting and maintenance costs
- Preserved a **distraction-free academic experience**

## 🚫 No Google Ads. Ever.

![Revenue Overview](images/money.png)

UniCheatSheet is **not monetized in any form via Google Ads** — and never will be.

There are:
- ❌ No Google Ads  
- ❌ No pop-ups  
- ❌ No auto-playing banners  
- ❌ No distraction-driven monetization  
- ❌ **No paid subscriptions**

The guiding philosophy is simple:

> **If a student is willing to go out of their way to study,  
their focus should never be interrupted.**

And more importantly:

> **Knowledge should be free and accessible, not gated behind paywalls.**

For this reason, UniCheatSheet has **never introduced a subscription model**, even though it
was a viable revenue option. Every core feature remains freely accessible to all students.

Every design and monetization decision was made to **protect student attention and access**,
especially during high-pressure exam periods.

### Revenue Transparency

The platform intentionally prioritizes focus and accessibility over profit.  
As a result, revenue has always remained **minimal and secondary** to the student experience.

This was a deliberate choice to avoid intrusive monetization, even at the cost of
slower financial growth.
